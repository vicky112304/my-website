    <h1>The Importance of Self-Care</h1>
    <p>Self-care is crucial for maintaining good physical and mental health. It's important to take care of yourself so you can perform at your best and be there for others. Here are some tips for incorporating self-care into your daily routine:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make time for exercise, even if it's just a short walk around the block.</li>
      <li>Eat a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.</li>
      <li>Get enough sleep, aiming for 7-9 hours per night.</li>
      <li>Practice mindfulness, such as meditation or yoga.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's also important to make time for activities you enjoy, such as <em>reading</em>, <strong>hiking</strong>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">listening to music</a>. Even small things like taking a relaxing bath or going for a walk can make a big difference. 
    </p>
    <p>Remember, self-care isn't selfish; it's <mark>essential</mark> for maintaining your health and well-being. So, be <code>kind</code> to yourself and make self-care a <abbr title="Priority">priority</abbr> in your life.</p>
